                  <p>Among all my friends there is the one i adore the most.I call him Tygar.He is a short skinny friendly
                    person,a very naughty one even in serious matters.He is a person of his own kind,he is full of jokes 
                    and always have a smile on his face,of which he keeps even if he is hurt.He is a dj liked by most of the
                    people who get to know him also he is polite to strangers.He is a dj by the name Dj Kaizer.at his spear
                    time he sets his ones and twos,taping and mixing differend beats and songs or spent time at work,if not 
                    work he stays indoors and watch movies.On top of all the hard work he does of being a dj,he is also a hair
                    stylist,he works at progress hair and beauty lon,it is where he manages all kinds of hair turning them into
                    something that amazes a lot of people.I like him because he is a hard worker in all work he does, i also 
                    like his confidence in handgling people's hair and hiting songs together to change peoples bored mood to a
                    joyfull mood.</P>

                    <br>
                    <p>There goes my other beloved friend.His name is Fenzi.He is a dark skined short guy from sekamaneng who is
                     proud to be a Butch and does not commit with people trying to change him.he is a student stuuding
                    tv and sodial broadcasting.The guy is not just a student but also a soccer player in one of the girls soccer
                    club.Moreover,he loves music more than anything.Most of the time he is busy writting his own lyrics.
                    what i like about his is that he officially turned himself into a new person without minding what people might think of him.
                   "her" turning into a male might have brought alot of challenges but ey!he just stood up and passed through all of 
                    them.along the way of catching up with the universe he enjoys travelling with his bike.</p>
